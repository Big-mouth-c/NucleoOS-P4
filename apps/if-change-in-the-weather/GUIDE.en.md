# A Change in the Weather

## The game

Walking away from a picnic you are caught in a country storm and must save a bridge. Short and tricky.

- **Author:** Andrew Plotkin (1995)
- **Game language:** English
- **Format:** Z-machine v5, Frotz 2.55 interpreter

## How to play

This is a **text adventure** (interactive fiction): the game tells you where you are, you type what to
do in short sentences, in English, and press Enter. Start by looking around.

| Command | Short | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `LOOK` | `L` | describe where you are |
| `INVENTORY` | `I` | what you are carrying |
| `NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN` | `N S E W U D` | move (also NE, NW, SE, SW, IN, OUT) |
| `EXAMINE lamp` | `X LAMP` | look closely at something |
| `TAKE lamp / DROP lamp` | `GET` | pick up / put down |
| `OPEN door, PUSH button, TALK TO man` |  | act on things and people |
| `AGAIN` | `G` | repeat the last command |
| `WAIT` | `Z` | let time pass |
| `SAVE / RESTORE` |  | save / load the game |
| `UNDO` |  | take back one move |
| `QUIT` | `Q` | leave the game |

Tips: examine everything (`EXAMINE` / `X`), take what you can, try the exits the descriptions
mention, and if you are stuck read the room again with `LOOK`. Many games understand `HELP` or `HINT`.
`UNDO` takes back one move.

## Saving

`SAVE` asks for a file name (Enter accepts the suggested one) and writes it to the app's data folder
on the SD card (`/sdcard/apps/if-change-in-the-weather/data`). `RESTORE` loads it back, even after closing the
Terminal. `QUIT` leaves the game.

## In the Terminal

- **Tap the icon** to open the Terminal with the game already running, or open **Terminal** and type `if-change-in-the-weather`.
- Type in the bottom line and press Enter: the line goes to the game.
- **STOP** kills the game right away (without saving).
